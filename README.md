Title: Travel Planner Using Graphs  
This project utilizes advanced graph data structures and algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s and BFS/DFS to 
plan optimal routes, considering distance, time, cost, and user preferences. Integrating real-time data 
via APIs, it provides a seamless interface with applications in navigation, logistics, and travel 
services for efficient route optimization.
